## BioinformaticsScripts
Collection of Scripts for Tasks in Bioinformatics 

Here you can find a collection of scripts that I used for various projects of the AG Damm. Dependencies to successfully run the scripts are stated in the __header__ of each script.

### FishPlot pipeline

This script uses the tools [SciClone](https://github.com/genome/sciclone), [Clonevol](https://github.com/hdng/clonevol) and [FishPlot](https://github.com/chrisamiller/fishplot) to generate fishplots from a VAF-table. For each step in this pipeline tables and figures are generated.

 + R-scripts needed:
	+ `CreateFishPlotFromVAF.R `
