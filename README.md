### FishPlot pipeline

To generate a fishplot a pipeline of [SciClone](https://github.com/genome/sciclone), [Clonevol](https://github.com/hdng/clonevol) and [FishPlot](https://github.com/chrisamiller/fishplot) is needed in advance of the establishment of a fishplot. For each step in this pipeline tables and figures are generated.

 + R-scripts needed:
	+ `CreateFishPlotFromVAF.R `
